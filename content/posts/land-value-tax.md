A Land Value Tax (LVT) is a tax on the unimproved value of land. It is based solely on the location, size, and desirability of the land and excludes any buildings, structures, or other improvements made by the owner.

LVT is rooted in the idea that while people are entitled to the value they produce from their labor and capital, the value of land comes from nature and the surrounding community and therefore should be reinvested into the public.


## The Justification for Taxing Land.
When we examine common forms of taxation—such as income tax, sales tax, and property tax—it becomes clear why many consider these taxes unjust. What someone creates through their own labor rightfully belongs to them. This idea is often summed up by the phrase: *"You are entitled to the fruits of your labor."* If you choose to trade the product of your labor with someone else, that transaction is a voluntary exchange between individuals. And if your labor produces capital—say, a machine that generates further wealth—you are likewise entitled to the returns that capital produces.

Land, however, is fundamentally different. No individual created the land; it existed long before the first humans walked the Earth. Throughout history, land has been something to be claimed and conquered—whether by ancient empires, conquistadors, imperialists, and apparently now, presidents. If we had the ability to create land, perhaps we wouldn't take it from others.

Now suppose someone buys land in a rural area. Years later, the surrounding area is developed with homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Naturally, the value of that person's property will increase. But the important question is: **who created that increase in value?** Assuming that the property owner didn't make any significant capital improvements to their home, the value appreciation came from the community—through new neighbors, shops, roads, and public services.

If businesses open up a few minutes from your home and your home value rises as a result, it’s not because of anything you did. You're benefiting from the efforts of others. And that’s precisely why, as land values increase, so does the LVT. These taxes help return that value back to the community that created it.


## Economic Benefits of Only Taxing Land
If the philosophical or ethical justifications for Land Value Tax haven’t convinced you, perhaps the economic case will.

There’s a common phrase in discussions about taxation: *“If you want less of something, tax it.”* This holds true for most types of taxes—but notably, **not** for land.

Sales tax is a great example. It's easy to see that when everything you buy is more expensive than the sticker price, people are discouraged from spending. And since one person’s spending is another person’s income, this reduction in spending leads to a slowdown in economic activity.

Property tax, as it's commonly implemented, taxes both the value of the land **and** the improvements made to it. When property taxes are high, homeowners may hesitate to invest in upgrades—like finishing a basement, building a deck, or adding a garage—because those improvements increase their tax bill. The result? Fewer construction jobs, less local spending, and reduced economic activity.

Income taxes follow the same logic. When people are taxed on what they earn, they have less money to spend. And again, if people are spending less, others are earning less.

Now here’s the part you’ve been waiting for: what happens when you **tax land**?

If you were worried that your property might vanish into a black hole, rest easy—your land isn’t going anywhere. In fact, taxing land encourages more economic activity. When a landowner's tax bill rises—say, because their community has grown and their land is now more valuable—they're incentivized to make the most of that land to offset the tax burden.

For instance, they might hire a contractor to build an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) and rent it out. In this scenario:

- A builder gets hired (stimulating the local economy),
- There's no additional sales tax on the construction labor,
- The improvement itself isn't taxed (since we’re only taxing land, not buildings),
- The owner earns rental income (untaxed under a pure land value tax),
- And that rental income can help cover the higher land tax.

That’s a lot of economic activity—without the deadweight loss typically associated with other taxes.

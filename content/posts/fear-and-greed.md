## Fear and Greed
Managing risk is about managing emotions. The two emotions that govern the market are fear and greed.  There is even a [Fear and Greed Index](https://feargreedmeter.com/) that you can checkout to see which emotion is currently dominating the market. Greed builds up slowly over time in a rising market while fear erupts suddenly in a crash. Lets explore these emotions in detail.

### Greed: The slow build of Optimism
In the stock market, greed is a desire for more profits. During a raging bull market it is common to hear stories from neighbors, colleagues, and even strangers on how they've made **enormous** profits in high risk assets. In more recent times, these high risk assets have come in the form of tech stocks, meme stocks, and crypto. Even though your own portfolio has been doing very well it is nothing in comparison to these great success stories. When you start to feel the FOMO and consider getting into these risky assets you are experiencing greed. 

The thing is, if someone already profited on that investment, it is often too late for you to do the same. They bought low and sold high, which means you will have to buy high and hope to sell higher. When many people give in to this behavior it leads to overvaluation and potential market bubbles. 
Additionally people who are successful are more likely to share their stories, while those who have lost money are less likely to share their stories. This leads to an overestimation of success and can mislead people into thinking that success is more common than it actually is. This is what is known as *survivorship bias*.

### Fear: The sudden onset of panic
Fear, in the stock market, is a response to loss and uncertainty. Unlike Greed, which slowly develops over time during a rising market, fear is triggered by a sharp unexpected drop in the market. While greed trickled into your life over the course of months or years, fear showed up for everyone all at once on the same day. The news of a sharp decline in the market will be on every news channel and everyone at work will be talking about it. This is when you will be compelled to checkout your investment portfolio. You see a devastating drop in your account value and you are tempted to panic sell. You are experiencing fear. ...

### "Dont just do something, stand there!"
When experiencing fear or greed in the market, the best option is always to do nothing. Members of the investing community often use the phrase "Don't just do something, stand there!" to describe this lack of action. However this is easier said than done, so I am going to share some tips on how you can guard yourself against fear and greed.

### Tips for managing Greed.
It is recommended to allocate up to 5% of your portfolio towards "fun money". Having an allocation towards fun money allows you to scratch the itch of FOMO and invest in high risk positions that you normally wouldn't want to invest your core portfolio in. This could be a speculative stock or commodity you overheard someone talking about or maybe you just have a favorite company and want to own some of their stock. Whatever the reasoning is, you can invest in whatever you want as long as it is 5% or less of your portfolio. In the best case scenario you make a decent profit. Just make sure to sell any excess if the investment increases to more than 5% of your portfolio. In the Worse case scenario you only lose up to 5% of your portfolio and you live and learn.

### Tips for managing Fear.
When you are stricken with fear and are considering panic selling you need to change your perspective on what is happeneing to your account. Instead of being hyper-fixated on the account value, focus on how many **shares** you have. The goal of investing is to have as many shares as possible. The only way to increase the number of shares is to buy. And the only way that you can lose shares is if you sell. Both of these actions are within your control. Feel the comfort of having that control during a time that is very much out of your control. Now if the goal of investing is to have as many shares as possible, and the market is currently in a sharp decline, then in a way, the stock market crash can be percieved as huge blowout sale of stocks!

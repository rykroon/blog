title = 'Money Is a Unit of Measure'
+++

For the past few years I have been on a journey to truly understand what money is; exploring the intersection of economics, finance, history, and anthropology. It started when I came across Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) via Stephanie Kelton's book, "The Deficit Myth" a few years ago, and has now lead me to begin reading Anthropologist David Graber's book "Debt: The first 5,000 years".

The idea that has captured my recent attention is the notion that Money, rather than being a material item, is a unit of measure. The same way that an inch or a centimeter is a unit of measure.

There's a common nostalgia for the days when money was "backed by gold". The good old days of the Gold Standard. It gave our money this sense of tangibility. This way of thinking is rooted in the **Commodity Theory of Money**, which claims that money has intrinsic value, often tied to something like gold or silver.

Now imagine if someone longed for rulers to be made of gold instead of wood or plastic? Wouldn't that be silly? It doesn't matter what the ruler is made of, it just measures things, the same goes for money.

Picture a gold bar. It has physical properties such as length, width, height, and weight, which we measure in inches, centimeters, pounds, or ounces. But it also has a more subjective property: its value to humans (we love rare shiny things). And we measure that value in dollars, pounds, euros, or yen.

See what I’m getting at?

It’s no coincidence that the word “pound,” used in the U.S. as a unit of weight, is also the name of the British currency. Both are just units of measure, one for weight, the other for value.

Now when you _have_ money, all that means is that you have a claim to resources in the economy that are considered equal in value to the amount you hold.

It’s kind of like earning tickets at an arcade. The tickets themselves are meaningless, the arcade can print as many as they want. What matters is that those tickets can be redeemed for prizes. In other words, money only has meaning because there's an economy behind it.

If you were the last person on earth and had all of the money in the world, what would you actually have? You would have nothing. There wouldn't be anyone to trade with. No goods or services. Just numbers.

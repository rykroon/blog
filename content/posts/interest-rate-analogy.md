I thought of an analogy the other day to describe what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to fight inflation. Before I get into it, I'll quickly describe what is happening when the federal reserves raises interest rates and why it reduces inflation.

When the economy is heating up and inflation is above the 2% target, the Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates do a few things. On one hand, people are encouraged to save their money since it has a greater potential to earn interest. On the other hand, people are discouraged from spending on credit and taking out loans since the interest on debt is higher.

While these are good financial habits at an individual level, when everyone starts doing this at the same time, it slows down the economy.

This is because one person's spending is another person's income. If consumers cut back on spending, then businesses lose revenue. If businesses lose revenue, then they often respond by cutting jobs. If people lose jobs then they can't spend or pay off their debts. This spiral continues and if interest rates remain high for too long then a recession or even a depression can follow. Now this reduction of economic activity does in fact solve the inflation problem, but it comes at the cost of hurting the broader economy.

Okay, so here's the analogy I thought of to describe this situation.

Imagine someone having a panic attack, their state of panic is analogous to rising inflation. Naturally, we want to calm them down, the same way that we'd want to reduce inflation. Now imagine if the only tool at our disposal is a pillow to press down on their face until they pass out. That would stop the panic attack, but now the individual is passed out, which is hardly a better state to be in. This state of unconciousness represents the economy entering a recession or depression.

The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment and maintain stable prices. But the only tool at their disposable is a simple lever, the federal funds rate. This is a classic example of ["Maslow's Hammer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument), a cognitive bias summed up by the phrase, _"If all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail"_.

A **Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP)** occurs when a central bank sets its benchmark interest rate at or near 0%. I argue in favor of ZIRP, as interest rates above zero can distort markets, suppress economic activity, and exacerbate wealth inequality.

Before diving into why interest rates should be zero, let’s first take a moment to understand the system that surrounds them: **Who sets interest rates?** And **why do they set them?**

## Understanding the Federal Funds Rate
In the United States, the **Federal Reserve** sets the benchmark interest rate known as the **federal funds rate**. The Fed operates under what is called a “**dual mandate**” from Congress: it is tasked with promoting maximum employment and maintaining stable prices, in other words, keeping both **inflation** and **unemployment** in check. To achieve these goals, the Fed relies primarily on one tool: the federal funds rate.

When inflation is high, the Fed raises interest rates. This is intended to cool down the economy. Higher rates discourage consumers and businesses from borrowing money due to the increased cost of debt. At the same time, they encourage saving, since the return on savings accounts and fixed-income investments rises. The result is **less spending, less investment, and slower economic activity**, all of which can help reduce inflation.

Conversely, when unemployment is high, typically during a recession or economic downturn, the Fed lowers interest rates. Cheaper borrowing costs encourage both consumers and businesses to take out loans and invest. This leads to **more capital investment, more business activity, and more hiring**. Low interest rates also discourage saving, since the returns are negligible and often don’t keep pace with inflation, nudging people to **spend or invest their money instead of letting it sit idle**.

## Part One: The Diverging Realities of Monetary Policy
Interest rates are often treated as abstract tools for managing inflation and employment, but their effects are anything but abstract. When the Federal Reserve moves its benchmark rate, the impact ripples out unevenly across the economy. To really understand what’s at stake, we need to shift from the bird’s-eye view to the ground level, where interest rate policy shapes the lives of everyday workers very differently than it does the ultra-wealthy.

### The Working Class: Disciplined into Recession
Imagine a single mother in her 30s working two jobs to cover rent, groceries, and daycare. She’s managed to stay out of credit card debt, but she’s constantly one unexpected expense away from falling behind. When interest rates rise, she’s told it’s for the good of the economy—to tame inflation. But on the ground, the effect is suffocating.

Her car loan gets more expensive. The mortgage she was hoping to qualify for suddenly feels out of reach. Even small business loans; her long-shot plan to open a home-based baking service, become much more expensive. So she tightens her budget. She skips dinners out, cancels her streaming services, puts off repairs.

And she’s not alone. Across the country, millions make the same responsible, self-protective choices: paying down debt, cutting spending, socking away what little they can into savings. On an individual level, it all makes sense. But collectively, it triggers a slowdown.

Less spending means local businesses bring in less revenue. Owners delay hiring. Some start laying off staff. The job market softens. That mom’s hours get cut. Her neighbor gets laid off entirely. Now they’re spending even less, not by choice, but out of necessity.

From the Federal Reserve’s perspective, inflation is easing. But down at street level, people are sliding backward. The trade-off isn’t abstract: we’re sacrificing jobs and stability in the name of price control. And it’s the working class who pay the highest price.

### The Wealthy: Rewarded for Standing Still
Now picture a wealthy investor, someone who doesn’t work for a living, because they don’t have to. Maybe they sold a company a few years ago, walked away with $50 million, and now spend their days managing a private portfolio from a beach house or penthouse office.

When interest rates rise, it’s not a threat. It’s a windfall. They don’t need to chase risky investments or roll the dice on startups anymore. They simply move their money into government bonds or high-yield savings accounts. At 5%, that $50 million earns them $2.5 million a year—without lifting a finger, without taking on risk, and without contributing anything to real economic activity.

This kind of passive income doesn’t change how they live. They’re already flying first class, already driving luxury cars, already eating at Michelin-star restaurants. An extra 2.5 million a year doesn’t lead to more spending, it just gets reinvested or added to their estate.

And while this doesn’t drive inflation, it does deepen inequality. Because while the working class is told to “tighten their belts” for the sake of the economy, the ultra-wealthy are quietly collecting bigger payouts for doing less. It’s a redistribution of wealth, not from rich to poor, but in the other direction, masked by the language of monetary policy.

### The Working Class: Empowered to Spend, Invest, and Participate
Imagine a young couple, she’s a teacher, he works in a warehouse. They’ve got student loans, a car payment, maybe dreams of starting a small business one day. In a low interest rate environment, the math starts to work in their favor.

Their student loan payments shrink. Financing a reliable car becomes manageable. Maybe they take out a modest home equity loan to renovate the kitchen, or finally invest in the equipment needed for a side hustle. With interest rates near zero, the cost of borrowing is low, and the returns, whether in time saved, income earned, or quality of life, start to add up.

At the same time, businesses in their town are also finding it easier to grow. A local restaurant expands. A logistics company adds a new delivery route. Jobs open up. Wages inch upward. Suddenly, this couple isn’t just treading water, they’re building momentum.

And with interest rates too low to make saving attractive, they’re nudged to participate: to spend, to invest, to put their money to work in the real economy. What begins as a small boost becomes a virtuous cycle. One that gives regular people a chance to move forward instead of just staying afloat.

### The Wealthy: Risk, Return, and Real Investment
Picture a wealthy investor, someone with $50 million spread across bonds, stocks, and a few vacation homes. In a high interest rate environment, they could sit back and collect millions in risk-free income from government bonds alone. But when interest rates drop near zero, that easy yield disappears.

Now, if they want to maintain their lifestyle or grow their fortune, they have to act. Maybe they shift some capital into early-stage tech startups. Maybe they fund a new apartment development, or back a promising clean energy company. The point is: **they have to take risk**, the kind that actually supports innovation, housing, or jobs.

And that’s not a bad thing. Unlike most people, the ultra-wealthy can afford to lose money. They have the resources to wait for long-term payoffs, to bet on uncertain ideas, to fund the future. That’s what makes them the right candidates to bear this kind of financial risk.

Crucially, this push toward investment doesn’t unleash a flood of new consumer demand. A billionaire doesn’t eat more meals or buy ten more couches just because their portfolio went up. So this shift, driven by low interest rates, doesn’t fuel inflation, it fuels **productive activity**. It puts idle capital to work. And it asks the rich to play a more useful role in the economy than simply earning interest for doing nothing.

## A Panicked Patient and a Blunt Remedy
Let me share an analogy that I think captures the problem with how we handle inflation.

Imagine inflation as a person having a panic attack. The ideal response would be to help them calm down, steady their breathing, reduce stress, maybe apply a targeted treatment. The goal is to restore balance without causing further harm.

Now consider how we often use the federal funds rate to address inflation. It’s like trying to stop the panic attack by suffocating the person until they pass out. Sure, they’re no longer panicking, but now they’re unconscious. That’s the economic equivalent of a recession. If you keep the pressure on too long, it becomes a depression.

I’m not claiming to have all the answers for managing inflation. But I do think we need to question whether this is the right tool for the job. Using interest rates to fight inflation can end up harming the very people and activity we rely on to keep the economy alive.

## Part Two: Why Pay Interest on “Risk‑Free” Debt?
Modern Monetary Theory reminds us that when the U.S. government issues Treasury securities, it isn’t borrowing in the traditional sense. Unlike households or businesses, a currency-issuing government can always meet its fiscal obligations. It cannot run out of dollars. This makes the risk of default effectively zero.

And if there’s no risk, why should there be a reward?

In financial markets, returns compensate for risk. Stocks offer higher potential returns because they carry high uncertainty. Investment-grade corporate bonds provide modest returns for moderate risk. Treasury securities, however, are treated as “risk-free.” By that logic, their return, the so-called “risk-free rate”, should be zero. Anything above that is effectively a subsidy: a payment to wealth holders for parking their money in the safest asset in existence.

And there’s a deeper question: if the government doesn’t need to borrow its own currency to begin with, why offer this financial instrument at all?

To be fair, there is one legitimate concern: inflation. Treasury securities carry no default risk, but they do carry inflation risk. That’s why inflation-adjusted instruments like Series I Bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) exist. These offer savers a way to preserve purchasing power without the government artificially inflating yields across the board. In that context, the real (inflation-adjusted) return on government debt can be zero, with the nominal yield simply tracking inflation.

Seen this way, Treasury securities aren’t tools for funding government spending. They’re a public service for savers. And that’s fine. But their role doesn’t justify guaranteed payouts, especially when the government assumes no risk. A truly risk-free asset should offer peace of mind, not passive income.

## Conclusion
At its core, interest is a reward for risk. But when the federal government, who issues its own currency, pays interest on debt that carries no risk of default, we’re not compensating for risk. We’re reinforcing a financial structure that benefits wealth holders simply for holding wealth.

Zero interest rates aren’t a radical idea, they’re a rational recalibration. They reflect the reality that public debt isn’t like household debt, and that financial markets don’t need government subsidies to function effectively. Most importantly, they shift our economic priorities away from rewarding passive capital and toward encouraging real investment, widespread participation, and broad-based prosperity.

A Zero Interest Rate Policy isn’t about denying returns. It’s about aligning them with actual risk, supporting the economy’s most productive participants, and building a financial system that works for everyone.

A Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) occurs when a central bank sets its benchmark interest rate at or near 0%. I argue in favor of ZIRP, as interest rates above zero can distort markets, suppress economic activity, and exacerbate wealth inequality.



## The Diverging Impact of High and Low Interest Rates
These dynamics are most clearly observed when comparing the circumstances of a working-class citizen and an ultra-wealthy individual in high versus low interest rate environments.

When the Federal Reserve raises the federal funds rate, interest on Treasury securities increases, as does the interest earned in savings accounts at commercial banks. Conversely, the cost of borrowing on business loans, mortgages, and student loans also rises.

From the perspective of a working-class citizen, this environment makes taking risks more difficult. For example, consider someone who wants to start their own business but lacks the start-up capital. They might consider taking out a loan, but if interest rates are too high, the risk may outweigh the potential reward, and they may abandon the idea altogether. This is a clear instance where economic activity is discouraged.

Now consider the ultra-wealthy individual—someone with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. They can simply place their money in a savings account and earn interest. For instance, depositing $10 million at a 5% interest rate yields a risk-free income of $500,000 per year. In this scenario, wealth passively generates more wealth.

Now let’s look at these individuals’ circumstances in a low or zero interest rate environment.

The working-class citizen, motivated to work hard and take entrepreneurial risks, can now borrow money to launch a small business without the same fear of being crushed by debt. This encourages economic activity at the grassroots level.

Meanwhile, the ultra-wealthy individual is no longer earning easy, risk-free income simply for having capital. To grow their wealth, they must seek returns through investments in the private sector, for example, in the form of venture capital. While riskier, these investments stimulate innovation and broader economic growth.


## No Risk, No Reward.
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it increases the demand for Treasury securities such as bonds, notes, and bills. In orthodox economics, this process is described as lending money to the U.S. government. However, from a Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) perspective, one could argue that lending a currency-issuing government its own currency is essentially a zero-risk investment. The currency issuer—in this case, the U.S. government—can always meet its interest obligations by creating more money. This is why we often refer to the interest rate on these securities as the "risk-free rate."

If the investment is truly risk-free, as I believe it is, then it follows that it should not offer a substantial reward. For comparison, stocks are typically considered high-risk, high-reward assets. Corporate bonds might be seen as low-risk, low-reward. Treasury bonds, under this framework, would be best described as no-risk, no-reward.

## A Counterpoint to Inflation Risk
Some argue that while Treasury securities may be free of default risk, they still carry inflation risk, the danger that the value of your returns will be eroded by rising prices. But this critique assumes that interest-bearing Treasury securities are a necessary fixture of the financial system.

From an MMT perspective, that's not necessarily the case.

If interest rates were set to zero and remained there, the demand for Treasuries could vanish altogether. After all, if there's neither risk nor reward, why buy them? And if the federal government doesn't need to borrow its own currency—which it doesn't—then why continue issuing them?

In this scenario, the government could simply stop offering Treasury securities entirely. The "risk-free" asset class would disappear, and with it, the supposed inflation risk that comes from holding them. People could still save in the form of cash or bank deposits, but the mechanism of earning interest as compensation for inflation would no longer be relevant—especially in a world where monetary policy is managed through fiscal spending rather than interest rate manipulation.

In short, inflation risk tied to Treasuries is only relevant if Treasuries continue to exist as a tool of economic policy. If they are phased out or rendered obsolete in a zero-interest world, that risk disappears along with them.













## Ideas
Observe Zero Interest Rate Policy through the lens of Modern Monetary Theory.

Explain how the circumstances between an ultra wealthy individual and a working class individual are different depending on when interet rates are high versus when they are low.

In a high interest rate environment, people are given money (interest) in proportion to how much money they already have. The ultra wealthy are given risk-free money just for already having money. The working class are discouraged from borrowing, taking risks, and potentially starting new businesses.

In a low/no interest rate environment, people are given little to no money in the form of interest. If the ultra wealthy want to further increase their wealth, they must invest their money into private businesses, which can be risky, but it's the only way to make more money. Their investment stimulates the economy. For a working class individual, they are encouraged to borrow and take risks, which stimulates the economy.


In addition to high-risk high reward and low-risk low reward, there is also no risk no reward. Lending the government it's own currency in exchange for a fixed income asset has no risk and therefore it can be argued that because it conatins no risk, it should not have a reward.

An additional point, for those that are in favor of free markets. The Federal funds rate distorts the market of lending and borrowing.

A **Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP)** occurs when a central bank sets its benchmark interest rate at or near 0%. I argue in favor of ZIRP, as interest rates above zero can distort markets, suppress economic activity, and exacerbate wealth inequality.

Before diving into why interest rates should be zero, let’s first take a moment to understand the system that surrounds them: **Who sets interest rates?** And **why do they set them?**

## Understanding the Federal Funds Rate
In the United States, the **Federal Reserve** sets the benchmark interest rate known as the **federal funds rate**. The Fed operates under what is called a “**dual mandate**” from Congress: it is tasked with promoting maximum employment and maintaining stable prices, in other words, keeping both **inflation** and **unemployment** in check. To achieve these goals, the Fed relies primarily on one tool: the federal funds rate.

When inflation is high, the Fed raises interest rates. This is intended to cool down the economy. Higher rates discourage consumers and businesses from borrowing money due to the increased cost of debt. At the same time, they encourage saving, since the return on savings accounts and fixed-income investments rises. The result is **less spending, less investment, and slower economic activity**, all of which can help reduce inflation.

Conversely, when unemployment is high, typically during a recession or economic downturn, the Fed lowers interest rates. Cheaper borrowing costs encourage both consumers and businesses to take out loans and invest. This leads to **more capital investment, more business activity, and more hiring**. Low interest rates also discourage saving, since the returns are negligible and often don’t keep pace with inflation, nudging people to **spend or invest their money instead of letting it sit idle**.

## Part One: The Diverging Realities of Monetary Policy
But interest rates aren’t just economic levers, they have real, tangible effects on people’s lives.
To understand the consequences of interest rate policy, let’s compare how it affects two very different individuals: a working-class citizen and an ultra-wealthy investor.

### The Working Class: Disciplined into Recession
During a high-interest rate environment, many working-class citizens are discouraged from spending, either because they’re burdened with debt they’re trying to pay down before it becomes unmanageable, or because they’re debt-free and looking to earn a little extra by putting money into a savings account. On an individual level, these are responsible choices. **Paying off debt and saving money are both good personal finance decisions**.

But when monetary policy forces a large portion of the population to begin doing this all at once, it creates ripple effects throughout the broader economy.

With consumer spending down, and remembering that **one person’s spending is another person’s income**, businesses begin to see declining profits. As revenues fall, businesses often respond by laying off workers. Those newly unemployed individuals now have **even less** ability to spend or service their debts, creating a feedback loop that can spiral into a recession or even a depression.

From the standpoint of fighting inflation, this may look like success, after all, prices stop rising when spending collapses. But at what cost? We may avoid inflation, but we trade it for unemployment, instability, and economic suffering for the majority.

### The Wealthy: Rewarded for Standing Still
Now let’s look at a very different kind of individual: an ultra-wealthy investor with tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. In a high-interest rate environment, these individuals can **pull their money out of riskier investments** like stocks or venture capital and instead earn a generous, **risk-free** return by parking it in government bonds or savings accounts.

For example, someone with $10 million can earn **$500,000 a year** simply by sitting on their money at a 5% interest rate.

Because the ultra-wealthy make up a small minority, their increased financial security and potential for spending doesn’t stimulate the economy in the same way that widespread working-class spending does.

And crucially, **it doesn’t drive inflation**. The spending capacity of the ultra-wealthy is already maxed out, they aren’t suddenly buying more bread or rent or fuel just because their passive income increased. So this becomes a kind of stealth redistribution: a windfall to the wealthy in the name of fighting inflation, with no meaningful inflationary pressure in return.

### The Working Class: Empowered to Spend, Invest, and Participate
In a zero to low interest rate environment, working-class citizens are encouraged to spend and invest rather than stash money in a savings account. Debt becomes less burdensome, freeing up income for essentials, education, or small business ventures. Paying down loans is still wise, but no longer feels like a race against compounding interest.

Meanwhile, businesses benefit from cheaper credit, making them more likely to expand and hire. This leads to job growth and higher wages, creating a positive feedback loop: more income leads to more spending, which supports more business growth.

Low rates don’t just stimulate demand, they give regular people space to participate in the economy on better terms.

### The Wealthy: Risk, Return, and Real Investment
For the ultra-wealthy, low interest rates remove the luxury of earning passive income from safe, low-risk assets. To maintain or grow their wealth, they must turn to riskier investments such as stocks, startups, or real estate.

This shift isn’t just strategic; it’s productive. Capital chases real economic activity, not just interest payments. And because the wealthy are uniquely able to absorb losses, they’re best positioned to take on that risk.

Importantly, their spending doesn’t scale with income, so this shift doesn't meaningfully add to inflation. Low interest rates challenge the rich to invest in growth, rather than collect rewards for doing nothing.

## A Panicked Patient and a Blunt Remedy
Let me share an analogy that I think captures the problem with how we handle inflation.

Imagine inflation as a person having a panic attack. The ideal response would be to help them calm down—steady their breathing, reduce stress, maybe apply a targeted treatment. The goal is to restore balance without causing further harm.

Now consider how we often use the federal funds rate to address inflation. It’s like trying to stop the panic attack by suffocating the person until they pass out. Sure, they’re no longer panicking—but now they’re unconscious. That’s the economic equivalent of a recession. If you keep the pressure on too long, it becomes a depression.

I’m not claiming to have all the answers for managing inflation. But I do think we need to question whether this is the right tool for the job. Using interest rates to fight inflation can end up harming the very people and activity we rely on to keep the economy alive.

## Part Two: Why Pay Interest on “Risk‑Free” Debt?
Modern Monetary Theory reminds us that when the U.S. Treasury sells bonds, it isn’t financing its spending the way a household finances a mortgage. As the issuer of dollars, the federal government can always create the money needed to meet dollar‑denominated obligations. Default risk is zero.

If the debt is risk‑free, why reward it?

Markets already price risk: stocks offer high returns for high uncertainty; investment‑grade corporate bonds offer modest returns for modest risk. Treasuries, also known as the **risk‑free asset**, sits at the bottom. Logically, their yield should hover at zero. Anything higher is a subsidy to those who already have wealth.

The only genuine hazard is **inflation risk**. But we have purpose‑built instruments, such as I Bonds and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), that protect purchasing power without cranking up the economy‑wide interest rate.

Viewed this way, Treasury securities are less about funding government operations and more about **giving savers a safe parking spot**. That aim doesn’t justify paying out returns determined by policymakers, especially when those returns are divorced from any actual risk. A truly risk‑free asset should offer security, not a guaranteed payday.

A **Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP)** occurs when a central bank sets its benchmark interest rate at or near 0%. I argue in favor of ZIRP, as interest rates above zero can distort markets, suppress economic activity, and exacerbate wealth inequality.

Before diving into why interest rates should be zero, let’s first take a moment to understand the system that surrounds them: **Who sets interest rates?** And **why do they set them?**

## Understanding the Federal Funds Rate
In the United States, the **Federal Reserve** sets the benchmark interest rate known as the **federal funds rate**. The Fed operates under what is called a “**dual mandate**” from Congress: it is tasked with promoting maximum employment and maintaining stable prices — in other words, keeping both **inflation** and **unemployment** in check. To achieve these goals, the Fed relies primarily on one tool: the federal funds rate.

When inflation is high, the Fed raises interest rates. This is intended to cool down the economy. Higher rates discourage consumers and businesses from borrowing money due to the increased cost of debt. At the same time, they encourage saving, since the return on savings accounts and fixed-income investments rises. The result is **less spending, less investment, and slower economic activity** — all of which can help reduce inflation.

Conversely, when unemployment is high — typically during a recession or economic downturn — the Fed lowers interest rates. Cheaper borrowing costs encourage both consumers and businesses to take out loans and invest. This leads to **more capital investment, more business activity, and more hiring**. Low interest rates also discourage saving, since the returns are negligible and often don’t keep pace with inflation, nudging people to **spend or invest their money instead of letting it sit idle**.

## The Diverging Realities of Monetary Policy
But interest rates aren’t just economic levers, they have real, tangible effects on people’s lives.
To understand the consequences of interest rate policy, let’s compare how it affects two very different individuals: a working-class citizen and an ultra-wealthy investor.

### The Working Class: Disciplined into Recession
During a high-interest rate environment, many working-class citizens are discouraged from spending — either because they’re burdened with debt they’re trying to pay down before it becomes unmanageable, or because they’re debt-free and looking to earn a little extra by putting money into a savings account. On an individual level, these are responsible choices. **Paying off debt and saving money are both good personal finance decisions**.

But when monetary policy pushes a large portion of the population to begin doing this all at once, it creates ripple effects throughout the broader economy.

With consumer spending down — and remembering that **one person’s spending is another person’s income** — businesses begin to see declining profits. As revenues fall, businesses often respond by laying off workers. Those newly unemployed individuals now have **even less** ability to spend or service their debts, creating a feedback loop that can spiral into a recession or even a depression.

From the standpoint of fighting inflation, this may look like success — after all, prices stop rising when spending collapses. But at what cost? We may avoid inflation, but we trade it for unemployment, instability, and economic suffering for the majority.

### The Wealthy: Rewarded for Standing Still
Now let’s look at a very different kind of individual: an ultra-wealthy investor with tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. In a high-interest rate environment, these individuals can **pull their money out of riskier investments** like stocks or venture capital and instead earn a generous, **risk-free** return by parking it in government bonds or savings accounts.

For example, someone with $10 million can earn **$500,000 a year** simply by sitting on their money at a 5% interest rate.

Because the ultra-wealthy make up a small minority, their increased financial security and potential for spending doesn’t stimulate the economy in the same way that widespread working-class spending does.

And crucially, **it doesn’t drive inflation**. The spending capacity of the ultra-wealthy is already maxed out — they aren’t suddenly buying more bread or rent or fuel just because their passive income increased. So this becomes a kind of stealth redistribution: a windfall to the wealthy in the name of fighting inflation, with no meaningful inflationary pressure in return.

### The Working Class: Empowered to Spend, Invest, and Participate
In a zero to low interest rate environment, the financial conditions for working-class citizens shift meaningfully. Instead of being pressured to hoard cash in savings accounts that finally offer a decent yield, people are incentivized to put their money to work — whether by spending on goods and services, investing in their education or small businesses, or even entering the housing market.

The psychological and financial burden of debt also eases. Lower interest on mortgages, student loans, and credit cards frees up income for other uses. While paying off debt remains important, it no longer feels like an emergency driven by compounding interest. This breathing room allows people to plan for the future, not just survive the present.

Businesses benefit as well. With cheaper access to credit, they’re more likely to expand operations, launch new projects, and hire more workers. This creates a reinforcing loop: more jobs mean more income, which means more spending, which supports more business growth.

Low interest rates, in this context, don’t just stimulate demand — they increase participation. They empower everyday people to act as economic agents, not just economic costs to be managed.

### The Wealthy: Risk, Return, and Real Investment
For the ultra-wealthy, low interest rates pose a different challenge. When safe, risk-free returns disappear, passivity is no longer rewarded. Simply parking money in treasury bonds or savings accounts no longer generates effortless income. To maintain or grow their wealth, high-net-worth individuals must seek out investments with real-world risk and potential: startups, real estate development, research ventures, infrastructure funds, and more.

This shift isn’t just about portfolio strategy — it has macroeconomic consequences. When wealthy capital must take risk to earn return, that capital tends to flow into projects that actually produce something: new technology, new companies, new jobs. Low rates push capital toward investment, not extraction.

Yes, some of these ventures will fail. But the ultra-rich are best equipped to absorb those losses. In a zero-rate world, their economic role shifts from collecting interest to underwriting progress. They become stakeholders in a dynamic economy, not just rentiers sitting atop it.

And importantly, their spending — even if it increases — does little to stoke inflation. Unlike the working class, they aren’t suddenly buying more bread, gasoline, or rent. Their lifestyle doesn’t scale with income. So while low rates ask more of them in terms of risk, they don’t introduce much inflationary pressure in return.

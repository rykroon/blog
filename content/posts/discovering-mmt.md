title = 'Discovering Modern Monetary Theory'
+++

- Post about my journey to finding Modern Monetary Theory.

- Watching yet another attempt of Congress to raise the debt ceiling and potentially shutting down the government.
- Fearful of what might happen if the government defaults on its debt.
- Wondering if my US Treasury Bond Fund is actually a safe investment.

- While reading through the doom and gloom on r/Bogleheads I came across a comment from someone recommending a book called "The Deficit Myth"
- Thinking to myself. "There's no way I could possibly be convinced that the US national debt is a myth."
- Purchasing the book as a challenge.
- The logic expressed in the book was undeniable and filled in the gaps of knowledge left by the common narrative.

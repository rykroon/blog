title = 'The Scarcity Portfolio'

As an avid Boglehead investor, my portfolio is mainly comprised of a few low-cost index funds. However, sometimes the simplicity of the portfolio is a bit boring and I find myself wanting to invest in something more exciting. When I find myself feeling this way I allow myself to allocate up to 5% of my portfolio into "Fun Money".

Over the years I've had various Fun Money allocations, some made money, some lost money, but it doesn't matter because it's only 5% of the portfolio.

My latest Fun Money idea I have called **The Scarcity Portfolio**.

The idea is simple, invest in funds that are made of scarce assets, as opposed to productive assets like Stocks.

Below are the ETF's that make up this portfolio. I invest an equal portion into each fund.

- IAUM: iShares Gold Trust Micro
- SLV: iShares Silver Trust
- IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF
- ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust ETF
- REET: iShares Global REIT ETF

Let's go over each of these funds.

We've got `IAUM` and `SLV`, Gold and Silver, the precious metals that human beings have been obsessed with since the beginning of time. We use gold and silver for jewelry, manufacturing, and for some, a hedge against the end of times. As mentioned in my previous post, historically, we have pegged our currency to gold, known as the Gold Standard, and some people think it should continue to be that way, but they are wrong!

Next is `IBIT` and `ETHA`, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which I often like to think of as the Gold and Silver of the digital realm. (I mean we even refer to it's extraction as "mining".) Bitcoin has scarcity baked into the protocol. There can only ever be 21 Million Bitcoin and about 95% of the Bitcoin has [already been mined](https://bitbo.io/how-many-bitcoin/). It's also possible for some Bitcoin to be "lost", which would be the case if somebody misplaced the private key to their Bitcoin wallet.

I admittedly am not sure how Ethereum works in terms of supply, but I do know that there is not a set maximum supply like with Bitcoin. If you are interested, I did find a [link](https://coinguides.org/ethereum-supply/) describing how the supply of Ethereum works.

And last but not least is `REET`, which is the closest thing you can get to investing in land. Land is obviously a scare resource as we cannot create more land. I can go off on a tangent when it comes to the scarcity of land and housing, but I'll just mention the simple fact that people often refer to real estate as being a "good investment". But here's the thing, it's not a good investment because it is a productive asset, it's because it is a scarce asset. A house just sits there, and it will actually depreciate if you don't take care of it, but the land it sits on is scarce, and because as time passes the population increases, and the amount of land remains the same, and therefore the price of housing goes up! Okay I will stop there, I can find myself wanting to keep going. Perhaps I will post a rant about land housing in the near future.

Anyway, this is The Scarcity Portfolio. I don't know if it will do well or not, but that's okay, because it's only Fun Money.

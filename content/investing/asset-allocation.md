## What is Asset Allocation?
In the world of investing, you will often hear the term **"Asset Allocation"**. Asset allocation, as the name suggests, is the process of determining how much of your investments should be allocated to each asset class. The two most common asset classes that are considered when building a portfolio are **stocks** and **bonds**. Stocks are the high-risk, high reward asset and bonds, also referred to as **"fixed income"**, are the low-risk, low reward asset. There are other assets classes that exist such as **real estate**, **commodities**, **precious metals**, and, in recent years, **crypto currencies**. Understanding how to balance these asset classes is key to building a portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.

## What is the goal of Asset Allocation?
The goal of **asset allocation** is to manage risk. Each individual has their own **tolerance for risk**, and it is up to the individual to determine how much risk they are willing to take. It can take several years or even decades to figure out how much risk you are comfortable with and as you go through different stages of life your risk tolerance will change.

As a general rule of thumb you want to take on more risk in your younger years and less risk in your older years. This is because, when you are younger, you have more time to recover from a market crash. When you are older, you do not want to risk delaying retirement or having to go back to work (if you are already retired) due to a market downturn. Therefore, it's better to have a lower-risk asset allocation.

## Age-based asset allocation methods.
First, we will look at some of the more common methods of **asset allocation**. As I mentioned earlier, your asset allocation will change throughout your life. Because of this, most mainstream asset allocation methodologies are based on **one's age**. Prior to the 1990s, the most common rule of thumb was **100 minus your age** in stocks. So, if you are 30 years old, you would have 70% (100 - 30) of your portfolio invested in stocks, and the remaining 30% would be invested in bonds. If you are 60 years old, then you would have 40% (100 - 60) of your portfolio invested in stocks, and the remaining 60% would be invested in bonds.

Over time, the **100 minus your age** rule has shifted to favor more stock exposure. The rule eventually became **110 minus your age** in stocks and is now more commonly **120 minus your age** in stocks. This change was primarily due to interest rates becoming lower in the 1990s and 2000s, and then eventually nearing 0 after the **Great Financial Crisis** in 2008.

Stock/Bond allocation for age-based methodologies from age 20-70
| Age | 100 minus age | 110 minus age | 120 minus age |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 80/20 | 90/10 | 100/0 |
| 30 | 70/30 | 80/20 | 90/10 |
| 40 | 60/40 | 70/30 | 80/20 |
| 50 | 50/50 | 60/40 | 70/30 |
| 60 | 40/60 | 50/50 | 60/40 |
| 70 | 30/70 | 40/60 | 50/50 |


## Asset Allocation based on percentage toward retirement.
One of the main pros of age-based asset allocation is its simplicity. You only need to check your portfolio once a year, usually on your birthday, and update your asset allocation. However, there are a few edge cases where pursuing an age-based asset allocation may not be the best option. On one side of the spectrum, you have those who started investing very early and might be pursuing **FIRE** (Financial Independence / Retire Early). Conversely, there are people who didn’t start investing until later in life, for example, in their late 30s or beyond.

In the former case, the individual might want to transition to bonds sooner in life, as they got a head start and don’t want to wait until their later years to lower the risk of their portfolio. In the latter scenario, those who are older but are just getting started with investing might want to lean more toward stocks as they catch up to where they want to be.

For these individuals, or anyone who may prefer an alternative method, you can use the following formula:
```
Bond Allocation = Percent Toward Retirement / 2
```
This formula requires you to know your target retirement goal in advance. Although determining your retirement goal is outside the scope of this post, a general rule of thumb is to multiply your annual expenses by 25. So, if you spend $50,000 a year, you will need $1,250,000 ($50,000 × 25) to retire.

In this scenario, if you have $125,000 in investments, then you are 10% toward your retirement goal. Dividing by 2 gives you 5%, so you would allocate 5% of your investments to bonds and 95% to stocks.

See the following table to understand how your asset allocation would change over time using this method.
| Total Investments | Investment Goal | Percent towards retirement | Stock/Bond Allocation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 1,250,000 | < 1% | 100/0 |
| 50,000 | 1,250,000 | 4% | 98/2 |
| 100,000 | 1,250,000 | 8% | 96/4 |
| 500,000 | 1,250,000 | 40% | 80/20 |
| 1,000,000 | 1,250,000 | 80% | 60/40 |
| 1,250,000 | 1,250,000 | 100% | 50/50 |
| 1,500,000 | 1,250,000 | 120% | 40/60 |

From looking at the table you can make out the following phenomenon from this method.
- When you reach your retirement goal, you will be 50/50 in stocks and bonds.
- The change is exponential not linear. Your asset allocation may not change from year to year in the beginning, but then as your wealth increases you are likely to increase your bond allocation by several percentage points in a year.
- Additionally, the stock to bond allocation doesn't just move in the same direction over time.

If there is a market downturn that causes your portfolio to decrease in value and thus move you further away from your retirement goal, then you are going to need reduce your bond allocation and increase your stock allocation. This is probably my most favorite part of this method because in a market down turn it requires you to buy more stocks at a lower price.

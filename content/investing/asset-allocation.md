## What is Asset Allocation?

In the world of investing you will often hear the term "Asset Allocation". Asset allocation, as the name suggests, is the process of determining how much of your investments are allocated towards each asset class. The two most common asset classes that are considered when building a portfolio are stocks and bonds. Stocks are the high risk high reward asset and bonds, also referred to as "fixed income" is the low risk low reward asset. There are other assets classes that exist such as real estate, commodities, precious metals, and nowadays crypto currencies.

## What is the goal of Asset Allocation?

The goal of asset allocation is to manage risk. Each individual has their own tolerance for risk and it is up to the individual to determine how much risk they are willing to take. It can take several years or even decades to figure out how much risk you are comfortable with and as you go through different stages of your life your risk tolerance will change.

As a general rule of thumb you want to be more risky in your younger years and less risky in your older years. This is because when you are in your younger years you have a lot of time to recover if there were to be a market crash. When you are older and retired you do not want to risk having to go back to work because of a market crash so it's better to have a lower risk asset allocation.


## Fear and Greed
Managing risk is managing emotions. The two emotions that govern the market are fear and greed. See the [Fear and Greed Index](https://feargreedmeter.com/).

### Greed == FOMO
Now some may say "well I am not a greedy person, so I don't have to worry about feeling greedy". When understanding greed in how it relates to the stock market it is best to think of it as FOMO (the fear of missing out). When the economy is booming and your friend says they dumped all of their money into crypto, tech stocks, or meme stocks and doubled their money in a week and you look at your own portfolio and see just a few modest percentage point increases you are going to feel FOMO. This is what is meant by feeling greed in the stock market.

The thing is, if someone already profited on that investment, it is often too late for you to do the same. They bought low and sold high, which means you wil have to buy high and hope to sell higher. (This is how asset bubbles are created). Additionally people who are successful are more likely to share their stories, while those who have lost money are less likely to share their stories. This leads to an overestimation of success and can mislead people into thinking that success is more common than it actually is. This is what is known as *survivorship bias*.

### Greed: What to do and what not to do.
Regardless, when you see that risky asset climbing and climbing, you are going to feel the FOMO, what should you do and what shouldn't you do? Definitely **DO** **NOT** sell your investments in exchange for the risky asset. If you have the mental discipline the best thing to do is to do nothing. People in the investment community often use the quote "*Don't just do something, stand there!*".

Now if you do not have the mental discipline to not buy the risky asset there is another option. Many will recommend allocating up to **but no more than** 5% of your portfolio towards "fun money". This way you can scratch the FOMO itch without taking on too much unneceasry risk. Best case scenario, the risky asset increases, but if it ever becomes more than 5% of your portfolio then you should sell the excess. Worst case scenario up to 5% of your portfolio loses its value and you live and learn.

### Fear: "Dont just do something, stand there".
When the market inevitably crashes, which it will do during your working life, you are going to feel fear and uncertainty. This market emotion is much more straight forward and identifiable than greed. 

Thoughts
- Buy low and sell high, DO NOT sell low.
- Don't look at your account value, look at the number of shares. It can only go up if you buy and can only go down when you sell.
- A market crash is a Black Friday sale!
- If you do end up selling, do not try to time your re-entry into the market.
- Don't just do something, stand there.

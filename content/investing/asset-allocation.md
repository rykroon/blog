## What is Asset Allocation?
In the world of investing you will often hear the term "Asset Allocation". Asset allocation, as the name suggests, is the process of determining how much of your investments are allocated towards each asset class. The two most common asset classes that are considered when building a portfolio are stocks and bonds. Stocks are the high risk high reward asset and bonds, also referred to as "fixed income", is the low risk low reward asset. There are other assets classes that exist such as real estate, commodities, precious metals, and nowadays crypto currencies.

## What is the goal of Asset Allocation?
The goal of asset allocation is to manage risk. Each individual has their own tolerance for risk and it is up to the individual to determine how much risk they are willing to take. It can take several years or even decades to figure out how much risk you are comfortable with and as you go through different stages of life your risk tolerance will change.

As a general rule of thumb you want to be more risky in your younger years and less risky in your older years. This is because when you are younger you have a lot of time to recover if there were to be a market crash. When you are older you do not want to risk delaying retirement or having to go back to work if you are already retired because of a market crash so it's better to have a lower risk asset allocation.
